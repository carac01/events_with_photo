<h3>Guess the photo</h3>
<img id="photo" src="static/photo_blur.jpg">
<p><i>Information about the photo:</i> <br>
It is a fresco (1508â€“1512) painting by Michelangelo (part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling). <br>
It illustrates the Biblical creation: God gives life to Adam, the first man (Book of Genesis). <br>
There are a lot hypothesis related to the fresco.<br>
Michelangelo had a good background in human anatomy.<br>
American physician Frank Meshberger admitted (Journal of the American Medical Association, 1990) that it was encrypted the human brain in the image of God.<br>
On the other hand, it has been observed that the red cloth around God has the shape of a human womb (Enrico Bruschini, 2004).<br>
"Adam still extends out to God, showing his dependency on the Creator.
God sustains him, and although Adam appears complete,
he still stretches out to meet the simple touch of God.
The very image of God is the very image of Adam, and as they look into each other's eyes,
there is an intense and beautiful connection between them.
Adam looks at his creator with longing, and at this moment,
Michelangelo captured everything that makes human beings what they are.
The picture shows the threshold of creation as Adam stretches out to receive nourishment
that will allow his physical form to survive.
God stretches out to bestow upon his creation the spirit and the soul."<br>
It is the moment when the man receives a soul,
a passionate search for the divine, a thirst for knowledge and creativity.<br></p>
